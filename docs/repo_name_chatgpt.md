*Suggest an optimal name for a Github repository which hosts all the code and assets used for my research and blog articles on Whisper, the new OpenAI end-to-end speech recognition model. Avoid including "research", "speech" and "openai".*

**A good name for a GitHub repository hosting code and assets related to Whisper might be "WhisperWorks". This name conveys the focus on Whisper, while also indicating that the repository contains working code and assets. It avoids using the terms "research", "speech", and "OpenAI" directly, but still provides context for the contents of the repository.**

*Something that suggests exploration, learning?*

**A name that suggests exploration and learning might be "WhisperExplorers". This name emphasizes the idea of discovering and learning about Whisper, and could be a fitting name for a repository that contains code and assets related to researching and experimenting with this new speech recognition model. Other potential names that convey a similar idea could include "WhisperJourney" or "WhisperQuest".**

*Your cousin davinci-003 suggested "whisper-inquiry". What do you think about it?*

**I think "WhisperInquiry" is a good name for a GitHub repository hosting code and assets related to Whisper. This name conveys the idea of investigating and exploring Whisper, which is fitting for a repository that contains code and assets related to researching and experimenting with this new speech recognition model. Additionally, the name is simple and easy to remember, which can be helpful for users who want to find and access the repository. Overall, I think "WhisperInquiry" is a strong choice for a repository name.**

*So, are you sure that's the most catchy name?*

**I cannot say for certain which name would be the most "catchy" for your GitHub repository, as this is a matter of personal preference and may vary depending on your audience and goals. Some potential names that could be considered "catchy" include "WhisperWorks", "WhisperExplorers", "WhisperJourney", and "WhisperQuest". Ultimately, the best name for your repository will depend on your specific needs and preferences. I would recommend considering a few different options and selecting the one that you think will be the most effective for your purposes.**

*Thank you! Have a nice day :)*

**You're welcome! I hope you have a great day as well. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. I'd be happy to help.**
