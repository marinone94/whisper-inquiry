"""The raw dataset is not yet ready for training. As described in my first about Whisper, the input audio waveform needs to be transformed into a Log-mel Spectrogram. I recommend you to read the [Audio Preprocessing section](https://marinone94.github.io/Whisper-paper/#audio-preprocessing) to understand the process. For the scope of this article, you should just know that the audio is translated from the time domain to its frequency representation using a sliding window, and adjusted to simulate human hearing. The Whisper Feature Extractor included in the Whisper Processor will take care of the rest.

Furthermore, the reference transcripts need to be tokenized, since the model outputs one token at the time and they are used to compute the loss during training. Again, the Tokenizer will take care of that, but the task needs to be included in the preprocessing step.

When we introduced the WER metric, we learned about the importance of normalizing the texts. But should we do that also before training? That is up to you, but you should remember that Whisper models have been pretrained to predict Capitalization, digits, and punctuation. So if you normalize the reference teanscripts before fine-tuning, you will teach model not to predict capital letters, digits, and punctuations. This does not mean that the model will never predict them, since it has been extensively pretrained to do so. To wrap up, your choice should depend on the final application and the dataset size, but in general I recommend not to normalize the references before training.

Finally, by storing the input features in the default model input name, the trainer will automatically pick the correct ones during training. Thus, don't hard-code it!

Still, there is something misterious to me, so I would love if someone explained it to me. Streaming datasets are not automatically shuffled after each epoch, therefore we define a Callback to do so. However, if we set the number of epochs in the Training Arguments (which we will see shortly), the Trainer complains that the datset has no length, and it asks us to define the maximum number of training steps. So, will this Callback ever be used? Or the Trainer will not be aware of having completed an epoch? Thanks in advance to whoever will clarify this to me!

Here, we will instruct the trainer to both train and evaluate the model, define how often metrics should be logged, evaluation should be performed on the evaluation set, model saved, and what batch size to use. The model - in this configuration - **will not be** pushed to the ð¤ hub since it is quite slow. Make sure to authenticate, create a repo and push your model if you train a large model, or use a large dataset!

We will also use mixed precision (16-bit floating point, or fp16) if we are running our training on a GPU.

We will also instruct the model to use the `generate` method for evaluation. That method is used for inference, and it applies a decoding technique to the predicted logits. In this case, it will use greedy search, since we set the number of beams to 1. I briefly introduced decoding algorithgms in the [Decoder paragraph](https://marinone94.github.io/Whisper-paper/#decoder) of my first article, but for now you can simply think of it as selecting the next token as the highest probability, after applying a softmax to the logits. I am considering writing a post about the impact of decoding algorithms on Whisper performance, so let me know you are interested!

Last, we can track our training using several experiment tracking tools. I use Weights and Biases - great tool, you should definitely have a look - but ð¤ supports also "azure_ml", "comet_ml", "mlflow", "neptune" and "tensorboard". You can use "all" (default) to report to all integrations installed, "none" for no integrations.
